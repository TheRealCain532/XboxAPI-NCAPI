# XboxAPI-NCAPI
To install this, You can either grab the compiled version from the release page, or build it yourself then, open up your NetCheat folder and drop this entire folder into the API directory. 


This is an API plugin for NetCheat. You must have Xbox360 Neighborhood installed to use this. It's a little buggy and will sometimes disconnect when searching. If that happens, SAVE your search and then re-launch NetCheat.
